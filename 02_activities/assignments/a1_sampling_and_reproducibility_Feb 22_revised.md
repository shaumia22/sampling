# ASSIGNMENT: Sampling and Reproducibility in Python

Read the blog post [Contact tracing can give a biased sample of COVID-19 cases](https://andrewwhitby.com/2020/11/24/contact-tracing-biased/) by Andrew Whitby to understand the context and motivation behind the simulation model we will be examining.

Examine the code in `whitby_covid_tracing.py`. Identify all stages at which sampling is occurring in the model. Describe in words the sampling procedure, referencing the functions used, sample size, sampling frame, any underlying distributions involved, and how these relate to the procedure outlined in the blog post.

Run the Python script file called whitby_covid_tracing.py as is and compare the results to the graphs in the original blog post. Does this code appear to reproduce the graphs from the original blog post?

Modify the number of repetitions in the simulation to 100 (from the original 1000). Run the script multiple times and observe the outputted graphs. Comment on the reproducibility of the results.

Alter the code so that it is reproducible. Describe the changes you made to the code and how they affected the reproducibility of the script file. The output does not need to match Whitby’s original blogpost/graphs, it just needs to produce the same output when run multiple times

Please write your explanation here...
Stages of sampling:
1) Infected_indices = np.random.choice(ppl.index, size=int(len(ppl) * ATTACK_RATE), replace=False)
  ppl.loc[infected_indices, 'infected'] = True
This is randomly infecting a subset of people
function used: np.random.choice
sample size: 100
sample frame: 800 attendees to brunch and 200 guests to weddings

2) ppl.loc[ppl['infected'], 'traced'] = np.random.rand(sum(ppl['infected'])) < TRACE_SUCCESS
Randomly decide which of the infected people get traced
function used: np.random.rand
sample size: 100
sample frame: Those infected of the 800 attendees to brunch and 200 guests to weddings
3) event_trace_counts = ppl[ppl['traced'] == True]['event'].value_counts()
  events_traced = event_trace_counts[event_trace_counts >= SECONDARY_TRACE_THRESHOLD].index
  ppl.loc[ppl['event'].isin(events_traced) & ppl['infected'], 'traced'] = True
  Contact tracing based on the event attendance
function used: value_counts
sample size: 1000
sample frame: 1000(wedding and brunch)
The python script is not reproducing the same results as the post because the post is for 50000 trials whereas the code is only a small subset of it.
After changing the simulation repetition to 100, the results are not reproducible as we did not set a seed. Also, there is more variability every time we run the code since the number of repetitions is much smaller.
I put a seed =1 on line 20 and that makes the results reproducible.
